# FPIQ:  Forward Positioned Inverse Queues
#
# These are queue mechanisms that accept connections only from their rear-positioned 
# worker nodes that are authenticated with GPG Signature mounted via docker secrets.

# Why should you care?
# - It is a way to serve data from a remote location without ever giving the location away.
# - The workers can relay information from a chain of requests that is near-impossible to breach or reverse engineer.

# this denotes the fingerprint of the FPIQ you wish to have workers accept requests from.
