# always-fresh
"Always Fresh" is a collection of fetch programs for libraries using SHC static binaries so they always get the latest github release... always!   They also always clean themselves up after... always!  There is an always for MacOS and an always for Linux binaries.  It just makes life more simple when calling these in various Docker contexts.
